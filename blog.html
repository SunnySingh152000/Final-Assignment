        <h1>How to build a workout that works for you</h1><br>
        <p>Finding your dream routine can take time. And that's OK! Fitness isn't one-size-fits-all. It's all about finding the right balance and tools that work for you. Here are some ways you can personalize your workouts.</p><br>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>1. Add weights</h3></li>
            <li>Adding weights to your workout isn't just bomb for how your bod looks. Pumping iron can increase endorphins and boost self-esteem. Bonus: Research suggests that a steady strengthening routine can help you get a better night of shut-eye.</li><br>
            <li><h3>2. Pick up your muscle groups</h3></li><br>
            <li>There are lots of perks of a full-body workout. But some folks see better results when they target one or two specific muscle groups at a time. This also gives your other muscles time to recover.</li><br>
            <li><h3>3. Join the resistance</h3></li><br>
            <li>Resistance bands are designed with compound exercises in mind. That means they can help engage your stabilizing muscles and improve the overall quality of your workouts. They also get major brownie points for being so lightweight and portable.</li><br>
            <li><h3>4. Grab your gear</h3></li><br>
            <li>You don't need to spend big bucks on a brand-new #FitLife wardrobe. You just need a solid pair of sneakers and some breathable, supportive clothing.</li>
        </ol>
